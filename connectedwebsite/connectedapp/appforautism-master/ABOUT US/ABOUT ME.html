			Christie Ulloa is a rising senior at Bergen Academies in New Jersey and Nanayaa Amponsah is a rising senior at Bronx Preparatory Charter School in the Bronx. These girls joined Girls Who Code with no experience but as they joined the program they were able to learn to code in Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Through those computer language they were able to create Text Adventures, Random Generator, and small adventures games. While being at the program for 7 weeks and learning everyday for about seven hours they were able to bring their ideas together to create a website for autistic people with learning syndromes such as socializing with orders and include break pages so they won't be bored while using it. Their intention at first was to create an app so it will make it much easier for them scroll and swipe throw things in the different icons. It took them step by step for everything to work and make it a successful project. They were able to create a website for a certain audience without any interaction with autistic people but based on a book called Out of My Mind by Sharon M.Draper.  The book is based on a young child named Melody whose brain that doesn't function well and make it hard for her to interact with other because she can't speak well but make noise and murmur. Melody was later able to get a machine that made it easier to share her thoughts that she was able to make it to the spelling competition and be on television. Like Melody, the creators wanted to make an easier way for autistic people by combining all their weakness with little information they have and making into the website. Throughout their was difficulties, hopefully the children out there appreciate their project.

			HOPE YOU ENJOY THE WEBSITE&#9786;!!!
