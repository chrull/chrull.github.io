		<p id="rcorners4">Tip#4:If you need to give someone very important information that cannot wait, say "Excuse me, can I talk to you for a second?" </p>
		<p id="rcorners5">Tip#5: When having a conversation make sure there is distance between you and the person you are speaking to. Don't stand too close or too far.</p>
		<p id="rcorners6">TIP#6:While in a conversation, try to identify the person's emotions while they talk. (If you need help with identifying emotions look at the <a href="../emojimepart/emojime.html"/> EMOJI ME <a/> icon)</p>

		<p id="rcorners11">Tip#11: Don't be scared to interact with others. (Have Confidence) </p>
